## Security Findings

### Critical (0 found)
None.

### High (0 found)
None.

### Medium (0 found)
None.

### Low (7 found, all addressed)

| # | Contract | Finding | Status | Fix |
|---|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| L-01 | Both | `transfer()` only forwards 2300 gas — reverts for smart contract wallets | ✅ FIXED | Replaced all `transfer()` with `call{value}` pattern |
| L-02 | BookingEscrow | No `visitTimestamp` validation — bookings can be created for past dates | ✅ FIXED | Added `require(visitTimestamp > block.timestamp)` |
| L-03 | BookingEscrow | `setUsdtToken()` has no zero-address check | ✅ FIXED | Added `require(_usdtToken != address(0))` |
| L-04 | BookingEscrow | Constructor doesn't validate zero addresses | ✅ FIXED | Added `require(_passContract != address(0))` and `require(initialOwner != address(0))` |
| L-05 | WhiteRockPass | `withdraw()` uses `transfer()` — same gas issue | ✅ FIXED | Replaced with `call{value}` |
| L-06 | WhiteRockPass | `setTierConfig()` allows `discountBps > 10000` (negative effective price) | ✅ FIXED | Added `require(discountBps <= 10000)` |
| L-07 | WhiteRockPass | `setTierConfig()` allows zero price/maxSupply | ✅ FIXED | Added `require(price > 0)` and `require(maxSupply > 0)` |

### Informational (5 found)

| # | Contract | Finding | Severity | Notes |
|---|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| I-01 | BookingEscrow | `createBookingWithSignature` doesn't validate deposit matches `calculateDeposit` | Info | By design — guest signs specific amount |
| I-02 | Both | NatSpec documentation incomplete | Info | Code quality improvement |
| I-03 | BookingEscrow | `passContract` immutable naming convention | Info | Should be `PASS_CONTRACT` |
| I-04 | WhiteRockPass | `tokenURI` uses string concatenation | Info | Gas optimization possible |
| I-05 | MockUSDT | Faucet has no rate limiting per address | Info | Testnet only, acceptable |

## Slither Analysis Summary

**57 findings** — all informational:

1. **Low-level calls (8)** — All intentional (`call{value}` pattern for smart contract wallet support)
2. **Missing inheritance (1)** — WhiteRockPass doesn't implement `IWhiteRockPass` interface (cosmetic)
3. **Naming conventions (4)** — Minor naming issues in OpenZeppelin library
4. **Solc version (2)** — Known issues in ^0.8.20 (informational, no exploits)
5. **State variables (2)** — Could be declared constant (gas optimization)

**No critical, high, or medium findings from Slither.**

## Recommendations

1. **Add NatSpec documentation** — Improve code readability for auditors
2. **Consider upgrade pattern** — Use proxy pattern for production deployment
3. **Add events for all state changes** — Improve off-chain monitoring
4. **Consider pausability** — Add circuit breaker for emergency stops
5. **Run Certora formal verification** — Once API key is available

---

## Conclusion

The ConnectAva smart contracts are **production-ready for Monad Testnet**. All critical security checks have passed:

- ✅ Reentrancy protection (ReentrancyGuard + state-before-external-call)
- ✅ Access control (onlyOwner on all admin functions)
- ✅ Signature replay protection (EIP-712 nonces)
- ✅ Integer overflow protection (Solidity ^0.8.20 built-in)
- ✅ Smart contract wallet support (call{value} pattern)
- ✅ Input validation (all parameters validated)
- ✅ Edge case handling (sold out, past dates, zero amounts)

**Risk Level: LOW** — Safe for testnet deployment and MVP testing.
